! ! Modifier key remapping
! ! We want to rewire caps lock and control keys
! clear      lock
! clear   control
! keycode      37 = Control_L
! ! Caps -> Control_L
! keycode      66 = Control_L
! ! Control_R stays
! keycode     105 = Multi_key
! ! We apparently need to say that these are control keys?
! add     control = Control_L Control_R
! ! AltGr is Mode_switch
! keycode     108 = Mode_switch
